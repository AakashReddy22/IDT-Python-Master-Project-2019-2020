# IDT-Python-Master-Project-2019-2020
Displays the orbits of our solar system, interface asks user for certain attributes such as birthdate, and numerical figures to display a medley of data such as Light years, kilometers, miles, zodiac signs upon the request and desire of the user

A slideshow format of everything I am about to say:

The Play:

What I did for my project

1. Converted customary units into metric units (Mi to Km)
2. Converted metric units into light years (km to light years) 
3. Acquired your star sign 
4. Got to know an astronaut that shares your star sign and some facts about them
5. Got to see the planetary orbits of Earth and Venus using the GUI turtle

What will the simulation will look like?

1. The turtle graphics will have the sun as a small yellow dot at the center of the module
2. Next, there will be a red ring around the sun and that will be Venus 
3. Finally, there will be a blue ring around the red ring, and that will obviously be blue
4. There will be a small dot at the center, which resembles the center of the program. And yes, I did just lament that the sun is the center of the universe in this simulation. Dont @ me

What does the code do?

1. So as you know, the code creates orbits of planets and display them as rings.
2. However there is more to this. Firstly, the rings will have both x and y positions as well as x and y velocities that will be placed every single second. 
3. The program has these positions being placed down and a loop recreates this process multiple times 
4. The program will create the rings of the planet infinite times until the turtle module is canceled out of
5. The dots also overlap each other giving you the ability to see how much faster the orbit of Venus is than Earth 

The Star Sign and Astronaut

1. After using the converter, the program asks from which of the following dates were you born and you can click on whichever of them
2. Then the program reveals your star sign and then gives you an astronaut that shares your star sign 
3. After you get the astronauts name, you get background information on who that astronaut was and the major accomplishments in their career
